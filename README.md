Analysis using PowerBI for Amazon Seller's Beverage Sales for the clinet "CLOUDTAIL"


This repository contains a project focused on performing a beverage sales analysis for Amazon seller Cloudtail using Power BI. 

The goal of this project is to gain insights into Cloudtail's beverage sales performance, identify trends and patterns, and create visualizations for better decision-making.

Project Structure
The project is organized as follows:

data: This directory contains the sales data for Cloudtail's beverage products. The data can be obtained from Amazon Seller Central or any other relevant data source.
power-bi-files: Power BI files (.pbix) used for data import, modeling, and visualization. 
These files can be opened using Power BI Desktop.

documentation: Detailed documentation outlining the project steps, data modeling, visualization techniques, and key insights from the analysis.


Project Workflow

Data Collection: Obtain the sales data for Cloudtail's beverage products from Amazon or other sources. Export the data into a compatible format such as CSV or Excel.

Data Import: Use Power BI Desktop to import the sales data into the tool. Connect to the data source and follow the prompts to load the data into Power BI.

Data Modeling: Perform data modeling tasks in Power BI, including creating relationships, defining calculated columns or measures, and transforming the data as needed.

Visualization: Utilize Power BI's visualization tools to create charts, graphs, and tables representing the beverage sales data. Choose visualizations that provide valuable insights, such as bar charts for product sales or line charts for sales trends over time.

Filters and Slicers: Apply filters and slicers in Power BI to enable interactive exploration of the sales data. Users can filter the data based on specific criteria such as product type, date range, or geographical region.

Key Metrics Calculation: Utilize Power BI's DAX language to calculate key metrics for beverage sales analysis, such as total sales revenue, average sales price, or market share.

Dashboards and Reports: Combine visualizations into dashboards and reports that offer an overview of Cloudtail's beverage sales performance. Arrange the visualizations in a meaningful way and add contextual information.

Trends and Patterns Analysis: Use Power BI's analytical capabilities to uncover trends and patterns in the beverage sales data. Apply functions like time intelligence or forecasting to gain deeper insights into sales performance.

Sharing and Collaboration: Publish the Power BI analysis to the Power BI service, allowing relevant stakeholders to view and interact with the dashboards and reports. Enable collaborative analysis and decision-making.
